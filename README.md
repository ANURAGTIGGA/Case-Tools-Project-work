Online shopping complex 
In this 800 acres of campus here at NIT-T , we have only one Shopping Complex.
Many hostels are too far from it, making it difficult for students from these hostels to come up to 
the Shopping Complex everytime they are in need of something.
The simple idea of this Project is to make this Shopping Complex , centralized and easily accessable by ALL.
The Online Shopping Complex will provide a user friendly interface for students to order their products 
which will be delivered at their respective hostels within a given time-frame.

THE  SYSTEM:

1.	The system is all about converting the Shopping System from manual to online.

2.	Students can order products online from their hostels.
	
3.	The products will be delivered at their respective hostels.

4.	Administrator can ADD, REMOVE or EDIT product details.

5.	Students/ Customers can write Feedback.

6.	Administrator adds delivery reports to the Database.


The USERS:

1.	General Public

2.	Student (customer)

3.	Administrator

GENERAL PUBLIC , can use the system to view the products, their prices and quantity. They cannot purchase any item.

STUDENTS , can view and purchase products. They can also give Feedback.

ADMINISTRATOR , can add, edit and delete products. He can view daily sell and maintain deliveries.
